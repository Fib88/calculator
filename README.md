# Calculator
This exercise is a collaboration between Fib88 and MonoraxXiV.
It's for the becode course.

## The excercise  can be found here

## update:
This excercise includes MVC and OOP. 
We used two seperate branches as not too deal with too many merge conflicts and
solved problems mostly together. Our biggest challenge was working in OOP as we are
not familiar with the concept yet. We do see the benefits of working with classes.
